# Changelog

## Release evaluation (2025-12-14)
- Reviewed commit history: no semantic version tags found; treating site refresh as pre-release content.
- Release not created to avoid tagging without a defined versioning plan.
- Next steps: introduce semantic versioning (v0.1.0) once CI deploy workflow is added and automated checks are in place.
